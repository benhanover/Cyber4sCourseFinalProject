 1
  issue: actions with no tokens get delayed until there is a valid token and then execute
  steps to reproduce:
  1 - make sure you dont have any access or refresh token.
  2 - add 3 new rooms, refresh the page and no room should be there.
  3 - login and gain access token
  4 - refresh the page and the 3 rooms should apear

2 
  issue: creates 2 rooms instead of 1
  steps to reproduce:
  1 - login and gain tokens
  2 - delete access token
  3 - create room
  theory: because of BUG 1 the first request wait for a valid token and then it executes twice

issue: only after refreshing the page you see the room that created
