### Welcome To Room-in!

The place where you can find study partners in a click of a button, and study within the most ideal environment that was designed for an optimal learning experience.

Room-in provides you the environment you need in order to maximize productivity. We offer video chat rooms that you can either create or join by prefrences such as subject and room capacity. Create your own uniqe profile to let other users know you better.

Overcome the difficulty of studying alone by meeting new people that share your interests. We encourge you to travel rooms, expand and share youre knowledge, and most of all have fun doing that!
